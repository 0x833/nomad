# Target Plugins

Target plugins are used by the autoscaler to perform a scaling action against a
scaling target.

For a real-world example of a Nomad Target plugin implementation, see the
[Nomad group->count plugin](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad-autoscaler/tree/v0.3.0/plugins/builtin/target/nomad).

## Authoring Target Plugins

Authoring a target plugin in Go can be accomplished by implementing the
[target.Target][target_plugin] interface, alongside a main package to launch the plugin.

The [no-op Target plugin][noop_plugin] can be used as a starting point for new Target
plugins.

## Target Plugin API

The [base plugin][base_plugin] interface must be implemented in addition to the
following functions.

### `Scale(action sdk.ScalingAction, config map[string]string) error`

The `Scale` method is called by the agent during policy
evaluation. The `action` argument specifies the details about the scaling action
that should be made against the target (e.g., new value, metadata). Config includes
details about the scaling target (e.g., Nomad job name, AWS autoscaling group).

### `Status(config map[string]string) (*sdk.TargetStatus, error)`

The `Status` method is called by the agent in order to determine the current
status of a scaling target. This is performed as part of policy evaluation,
and the information returned may be used by the scaling strategy to inform the
next scaling action. Information returned includes current scaling level,
readiness, and arbitrary metadata.
